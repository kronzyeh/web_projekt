                                <h8>The company Dinoza d.o.o (Ltd.) Orašje was found  in 1990. Since then, it has been successful  in production and selling of the salted raw skin. Through several decades of tradition, it has developed and grown  and has eventually become one of  the prestigious companies in its field in the south-eastern Europe. With its hard work and dedication, the company positioned itself as a 90% exporter of domestic salted raw skin (simmental) which it places on the foreign market, such as neighbouring countries as well as other EU members. As their long- term  goal, the company is planning to start cooperating with countries of other continents. Trust, safety and quality are guaranteed by the internationally recognized certificates ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and HACCP.
                                     The company employs 23 workers, who perform their jobs very professionally and with high quality. There are five  members of management and administration. Other eighteen employees performs duties of the purchase, production, storage and shipping of skin. As a result of the  successful business, the number of employees as well as the amount of business has increased through the years. Today, the company has got more than 4000 m2 of storage space in Bosnia and Hercegovina (in Orašje) and 600 m2 of storage space in the newly established daughter-company in Croatia (in Bošnjaci).
